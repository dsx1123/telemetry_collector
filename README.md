# telemetry_collector
Automatically build telemetry collector with telegraf, influxdb and grafana, example of sensor paths is using native yang model and OpenConfig yang model of NX-OS as example. `build.sh` script will create self-signled cerificates for TLS transport. Using docker images of telegraf, influxdb and grafana to create containers with docker-compose. tested with `telegraf>=1.12.1`, `2.0 <=influxdb` and `grafana>=8.1`.

# NOTE:
This project has upgraded the influxdb to 2.0 which is not supported by chronograf anymore, dashboard is changed to grafana with new set of sensor paths. original code is moved to branch [chronograf_influxdb_1_x](https://github.com/dsx1123/telemetry_collector/tree/chronograf_influxdb_1_x)
# Screenshoot
![gnmi dashboard](https://github.com/dsx1123/telemetry_collector/blob/master/examples/gnmi.png?raw=true)
## Requirements:
docker-ce, openssl, docker-compose, any linux distribution, see Known Issues if trying it on MacOS
## How to use

 1. to quick start, use `sudo ./build.sh start` to start the containers:
    ```bash
     # ./build.sh start
    2020-07-30T22:49:02--LOG--influxdb database folder is not existed, creating one
    2020-07-30T22:49:02--LOG--change permission of config and data folder of influxdb
    2020-07-30T22:49:02--LOG--gernerating self-signed certificates for telegraf plugins
    2020-07-30T22:49:02--LOG--telegraf certificate does not exist, generating
    2020-07-30T22:49:02--LOG--gernerating private key for CN telegraf
    ...<ommited>
    ```

    By default, telegraf listens on `tcp:57000` for gRPC dial-out, if you want to modify the port, change the config file `etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` in project folder

    gnmi dial-in is also enabled by default,  modify the `switches` in `build.sh` with mgmt address and grpc port:
    ```ini
    # swtiches accept gNMI dial-in
    switches=( "172.25.74.70:50051" "172.25.74.61:50051" )
    ```
    To change the username and password of gnmi plugin modify it in `build.sh`:
    ```ini
    # user on swtich for authentication, need network-operator role at least
    gnmi_user="telemetry"
    gnmi_password="cisco123"
    ```

    When first start the service, script will check if certificates are genearted, if not will create them for mdt and gnmi plugin validate for 10 years.
    use `http://<ip_address_of_host>:8888` to open chronograf gui.

2. TLS is enabeld on cisco_telemetry_mdt plugin, comment below lines in `etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf` to disable it:
    ```ini
    # uncomment below to enable tls for dial-out plguin
    tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert/telegraf.crt"
    tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/cert/telegraf.key"
    ```
    certificate `./etc/telegraf/cert/telegraf.crt` need be copied to nx-os to verify the collector's identity, then use below command to enabled TLS transport for destination group, the `<certificate name>`  needs match the common name of `telegraf.crt`, it is set to `telegraf` in `build.sh`:
    ```
    switch(config)# telemetry
    switch(config-telemetry)# destination-group 1
    switch(conf-tm-dest)# ip address <collector address> port 57000 protocol gRPC encoding GPB
    switch(conf-tm-dest)# certificate /bootflash/telegraf.crt <certificate name>

    ```
3. TLS need be enabled for gNMI plugin as well as nx-os, when configure feature gRPC on switch, a default certificate with 1 day validation is auto-generated, to configure the certificate for gRPC on nx-os, copy `etc/telegraf/cert/gnmi.pfx` to bootflash, then use below commands to import the certificate, the `<export password>` is set to `cisco123` by default, you could modify it in `build.sh`
    ```
    switch(config)# crypto ca trustpoint gnmi_trustpoint
    switch(config-trustpoint)# crypto ca import gnmi_trustpoint pkcs12 bootflash:gnmi.pfx <export password>
    switch(config)# grpc certificate gnmi_trustpoint
    ```
4. It will import two pre-built dashboards. `fabric_dashboard` is example of querying data from telemetry dial-out, you can find the example of swtich telemetry config that is used for this dashboard in [telemetry.cfg](/examples/telemetry.cfg), `fabric_dashboard_gnmi` is example of querying data from gNMI dial-in.

5. Example of telegraf configuration can be found below:
   - [telegraf.conf](etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf) example of cisco_telemetry_mdt config
   - [gnmi.conf.example](etc/telegraf/telegraf.d/gnmi.conf.example) exmaple of sample-based gnmi plugin config
   - [gnmi_on_change.conf.example](etc/telegraf/gnmi_on_change.conf.example) exmaple of event-based plugin config

## Known issue
1. Currently on nx-os, a single subscription of gNMI dial-in can only be SAMPLE or ON_CHANGE, not both. In order to configure different type of subscription, need start two telegraf instances to seperate SAMPLE and ON_CHANGE sensor paths.
Please refer to enhancement [CSCvu58102](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu58102) for detail and this limiation has been lifted in 10.1.1.
2. MacOS uses BSD version of sed by default which doesn't work with this script, use `brew install gnu-sed` to install the gnu version of sed if you are trying this script on MacOS.
